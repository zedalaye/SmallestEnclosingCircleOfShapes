# SmallestEnclosingCircleOfShapes
Delphi application that leverages the FMX framework to compute dynamically the smallest enclosing circle of a list of moving/rotating shapes

Heavily inspired by https://www.nayuki.io/page/smallest-enclosing-circle

Uses Firemonkey (FMX) features to render shapes as an array of points on which the Smallest Enclosing Circle algorithm is run.

Requires Delphi 10.3.3 to compile
